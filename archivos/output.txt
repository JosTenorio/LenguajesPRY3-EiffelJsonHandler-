9 Every class has the out method that can be
9 used to get a text version of the object.
5 For a lot of classes,
6 this method returns internal information 
9 that is not really useful for the end user.
5 But for every NUMERIC class,
8 the out method returns a text representation 
7 of the number that the NUMERIC object
3  represents.
